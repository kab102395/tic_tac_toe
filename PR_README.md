# Remove Copilot from Repository History

This PR provides everything needed to remove "copilot-swe-agent[bot]" from your repository's Git history.

## What's Included

1. **Automated cleanup scripts**:
   - `cleanup_history.sh` - For Linux/Mac users
   - `cleanup_history.ps1` - For Windows PowerShell users

2. **Detailed documentation**:
   - `HISTORY_CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete manual instructions

## How to Complete the Cleanup

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script (Recommended)

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./cleanup_history.sh
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\cleanup_history.ps1
```

The script will:
1. Rewrite all commits to replace copilot-swe-agent[bot] with kab102395
2. Clean up the repository
3. Prompt you before force pushing
4. Verify the changes

### Option 2: Manual Process

See `HISTORY_CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for step-by-step manual instructions.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **This will rewrite Git history!**
- Anyone who has cloned the repository will need to re-clone or reset their local copy
- This cannot be undone once force-pushed to GitHub
- Make sure you have a backup if needed

## Verification

After running the script, verify that copilot has been removed:

```bash
git shortlog -sne --all
```

**Expected output:**
```
     X	kab102395 <kab102395@users.noreply.github.com>
```

You should **only** see "kab102395" in the contributor list. If you still see "copilot-swe-agent[bot]", the history cleanup was not successful.

## Why This Can't Be Automated

Git history rewriting requires a force push to the remote repository. For security reasons, the automated agent environment doesn't support force pushing. This is a manual step that you, as the repository owner, need to approve and execute.
