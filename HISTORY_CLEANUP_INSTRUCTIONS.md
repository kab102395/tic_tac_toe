# Instructions to Remove Copilot from Repository History

This document explains how to complete the removal of "copilot-swe-agent[bot]" from the repository's contributor history.

## Background

The repository currently has commits authored by "copilot-swe-agent[bot]". To remove this contributor from the Git history, the commit history needs to be rewritten.

## Quick Start (Automated Scripts)

Two automated scripts are provided to make this process easier:

- **For Linux/Mac**: Run `./cleanup_history.sh`
- **For Windows**: Run `.\cleanup_history.ps1` in PowerShell

These scripts will guide you through the entire process with safety confirmations at each critical step.

If you prefer to run the commands manually, continue reading below.

## Steps to Complete History Cleanup

The history has been locally rewritten, but pushing these changes requires force pushing to override the remote history. Here's how to complete the process:

### Option 1: Force Push (Recommended for this PR branch)

1. **Fetch the latest changes from this PR:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin copilot/remove-copilot-contributor
   git checkout copilot/remove-copilot-contributor
   ```

2. **Rewrite the history using git filter-branch:**
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --env-filter '
   OLD_EMAIL="198982749+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com"
   CORRECT_NAME="kab102395"
   CORRECT_EMAIL="kab102395@users.noreply.github.com"
   
   if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL" = "$OLD_EMAIL" ]
   then
       export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
       export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
   fi
   if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "$OLD_EMAIL" ]
   then
       export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
       export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
   fi
   ' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags
   ```

3. **Clean up the repository:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .git/refs/original/
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   ```

4. **Force push the rewritten history:**
   ```bash
   git push --force origin copilot/remove-copilot-contributor
   ```

### Option 2: Create Fresh Repository (For main branch)

If you want to apply this to the main branch, consider creating a completely fresh history:

1. **Create an orphan branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout --orphan new-main
   ```

2. **Commit all files with your authorship:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Initial commit" --author="kab102395 <kab102395@users.noreply.github.com>"
   ```

3. **Replace the main branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch -D main
   git branch -m new-main main
   git push --force origin main
   ```

## Verification

After force pushing, verify the contributor list:

```bash
git shortlog -sne --all
```

You should only see "kab102395" as a contributor.

## Important Notes

- **Force pushing rewrites history**: Anyone who has cloned the repository will need to re-clone or reset their local copies.
- **Protected branches**: If the branch is protected on GitHub, you'll need to temporarily disable branch protection rules before force pushing.
- **Backup**: Consider backing up the repository before performing these operations.

## Alternative: Using GitHub's Settings

If you only want to remove the contributor from GitHub's contributor graph without rewriting history, you can:

1. Go to repository Settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Manage access" or "Collaborators"
3. However, this won't remove historical commit authorship - only Git history rewriting can do that.

## Why This Matters

Rewriting Git history removes copilot-swe-agent[bot] from:
- Git log output
- GitHub's commit history
- Contributor graphs
- Git blame annotations
- Any tools that analyze repository contributors
